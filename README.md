# Road Safety Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository 🚗📊

Welcome to the Road Safety EDA repository! This project focuses on the thorough exploration of road safety data, unraveling insights and patterns. Below are the technical details and steps followed in this EDA:

## Steps Followed:

### 1. Data Inspection 📂
- **Dataset:** The road safety dataset from Great Britain in 2019 is used.
- **Attributes:** 32 attributes including accident severity, location, time, weather conditions, and more.

### 2. Data Preprocessing 🛠️
- **Handling Missing Values:** Strategies employed to address missing data in various attributes.
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing inconsistencies, correcting data types, and ensuring data integrity.
- **Date and Time Conversion:** Transforming 'Date' and 'Time' columns to datetime format.

### 3. Feature Engineering 🧠
- **Creating New Features:** Deriving meaningful features to enhance analysis.

### 4. Data Visualization 📈
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Leveraging these libraries for insightful visualizations.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Plotting accident locations on a map using Geopandas.
- **Temporal Trends:** Exploring the distribution of accidents across different times of the day and days of the week.

### 5. Correlation Analysis 📊
- **Correlation Matrix:** Visualizing relationships between various attributes.

### 6. Outlier Detection 🚨
- **Z-Score Analysis:** Identifying outliers in numerical columns.

### 7. Iterative Analysis ♻️
- **Continuous Learning:** Iteratively refining analyses based on emerging insights.
- **Adapting to Stakeholder Needs:** Flexibility in approach to meet evolving project requirements.

### 8. Hypothesis Testing 🧪
- **Statistical Analysis:** Employing t-tests to test hypotheses related to accident severity.
